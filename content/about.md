Hi I'm Kristopher Ruzic, a generalist software programmer and passionate advocate for FOSS, decentralized computing and
self-hosted infrastructure.

In my spare time I'm working on a yet-to-be-released FOSS federated forum platform, and various Nintendo Switch homebrew
development projects. I'm a huge fan of self hosting and I run, administrate and configure various cloud applications
for my personal needs. I believe the future of computing and the internet depend on emerging decentralized technologies
like anonymous cryptocurrencies (shoutout to TurtleCoin), federated social media and uncensorable storage solutions. I
do everything I can to empower these platforms, if you're savvy you may have seen me a few places :)

I'm aspiring to be a bit of a blogger, I write about my programming experience and really anything to do with computers
here. If you'd like to get in touch or learn more about me, please see my CV.
